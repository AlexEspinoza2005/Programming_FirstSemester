# Programming Logic First Semester  

Welcome to the **Programming Logic First Semester** project! This repository contains a collection of Java programs developed during the first semester. It serves as a practical resource for practicing coding skills and problem-solving.  

## Description  

This repository includes various Java programs that cover fundamental programming concepts. Each program demonstrates different essential techniques, including:  

- **Variables and Data Types:** Understanding primitive and non-primitive data types.  
- **Control Structures:** Implementing conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).  
- **Functions and Modularization:** Writing reusable methods to improve code organization.  
- **Arrays and Basic Data Structures:** Managing collections of data efficiently.  

Explore the provided examples to strengthen your programming foundations!  

## Requirements  

To run the programs, ensure you have the following installed:  

- **JDK 8 or higher:** Make sure you have the Java Development Kit installed to compile and run the Java programs.  
- **NetBeans or any Java IDE:** You can use any Integrated Development Environment that supports Java, but NetBeans is recommended for ease of use with this project.
